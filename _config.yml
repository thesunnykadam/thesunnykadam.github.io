about_content: |
  I'm a Senior Site Reliability & Database Platform Engineer with experience in designing, operating, and migrating mission-critical, data-intensive systems across on-prem, hybrid, and multi-cloud environments.

  My work sits at the intersection of databases, infrastructure, and reliability engineering — building platforms that are highly available, observable, secure, and resilient by design.

  I've led and supported large-scale systems spanning Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, SQL Server, and YugabyteDB, with deep hands-on ownership of:

  · high availability & disaster recovery
  · performance tuning under real production load
  · zero-downtime migrations
  · calm execution during Sev-1 incidents

  I'm known for strong ownership, deep root-cause analysis, and close collaboration with application, platform, DevOps, and security teams.

        quote: >
          Established in 1978, Anna University is one of India's premier engineering institutions, renowned for its rigorous academic programs, research culture, and strong industry connections. The university emphasizes practical learning, innovation, and holistic development, producing graduates who are well-prepared to tackle complex technical challenges. My time at RMKCET, it nurtured my leadership, organizational, and problem-solving skills, providing a platform to take initiative, manage events, and mentor fellow students: all of which have shaped the professional I am today.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Completed undergraduate studies in Computer Science, building a strong foundation in systems, programming, and software engineering, while actively engaging in technical leadership, hands-on projects, and community-driven learning.

          Alongside academics, I held multiple student leadership roles including President of the Computer Society of India (CSI), where I coordinated technical workshops, seminars, peer-learning initiatives, and collaborated with faculty leadership to execute department-level technical activities and inter-college events. I also served as Patent & Projects Coordinator, Events Organizer, and Study Group Planner, supporting collaborative learning and technical skill development across the department.

          As part of my academic projects, I led the design and implementation of a Raspberry Pi–based classroom display infrastructure, replacing traditional projector PCs with lightweight Linux-based systems. The solution reduced hardware costs and power consumption while improving classroom readiness and ease of maintenance, following coordination with faculty for procurement, deployment, and training.

          Outside the classroom, I was actively involved in Linux systems exploration and self-managed environments, working across Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, Arch Linux, and Debian to understand system internals, boot processes, service failures, and recovery techniques. In parallel, I participated in the XDA Developers community, experimenting with Android ROM customization and kernel exploration to deepen my understanding of low-level systems and performance behavior.

          I also served as Computer Science Department Basketball Captain (2017), balancing academics and leadership while coordinating teams and representing the department in inter-department competitions. These experiences collectively shaped my early strengths in ownership, teamwork, systems thinking, and problem-solving, which later became the foundation of my career in database platforms, infrastructure, and site reliability engineering.
