about_content: |
  Senior Database & Platform Engineer with nearly 8 years of experience designing, operating, and migrating mission-critical database systems across Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, MS SQL, and YugabyteDB.

  I specialize in high availability, disaster recovery, performance tuning, and secure cloud/hybrid deployments across AWS, GCP, and on-prem environments. My work spans Oracle RAC & Data Guard, large-scale migrations, 24x7 production on-call, and infrastructure automation using Linux, Shell, Python, and Terraform.

  I'm known for calm incident response, deep root-cause analysis, and close collaboration with application, DevOps, and infrastructure teams to deliver reliable, scalable data platforms.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>AWS</mark> and <mark>Oracle Cloud</mark>
