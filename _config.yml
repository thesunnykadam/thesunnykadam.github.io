about_content: |
  I'm a Senior Site Reliability & Database Platform Engineer with experience designing, operating, and migrating mission-critical, data-intensive systems across on-prem, hybrid, and multi-cloud environments.

  My work sits at the intersection of databases, infrastructure, and reliability engineering: building platforms that are highly available, observable, secure, and resilient by design.

  I’ve led and supported large-scale systems spanning Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, SQL Server, and YugabyteDB, with deep hands-on ownership of:

  - High availability and disaster recovery
  - Performance tuning under real production load
  - Zero-downtime migrations
  - Calm execution during Sev-1 incidents

  I’m known for strong ownership, deep root-cause analysis, and close collaboration with application, platform, DevOps, and security teams.

  <mark>Data builds systems. Reliability builds trust.</mark>
